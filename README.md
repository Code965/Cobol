# Cobol

Cobol is a collection of cobol codes that I used to learn the language.
## Codes

 - Exercise 1 is a code used to create paragraphs that populate an array, print an array and search for an element passed by the user
 - Exercise 2 is The COBOL program which receives as input a Sequence of N integers. The numbers are stored in a vector The value N is entered by the user, but the vector can contain a maximum of 30 numbers. After entering the sequence of numbers, the program must check if the elements of the vector are all equal to each other
 - Exercise 3 is a cobol program that checks if the values in an array are strictly ascending
 - Exercise 4 is a cobol program that prints histograms
 - Exercise 5 is a cobol program that populates a vector and shifts the values to the left
 - Exercises 6 and 6BIS serve to generate a third vector which contains the intersection between two vectors. This verrote must contain the numbers present in both given vectors
 - Exercise 7 is a cobol program that sees which elements inside it are equal and calculates their number. The program takes the first occurrence of the array and compares it with the rest, if it is equal it counts 1 otherwise it goes to the second occurrence and compares it with the rest and so on until the end
 - Exercise 8 is a cobol program created to sort an array. It uses the bubble sort method, i.e. it compares the previous element with the next and compares them to understand who is the greater or the lesser then making an exchange to order them
 - Exercise 9 is a cobol program that serves to construct a vector of N positions, inserting in each element the value of its index
 - Exercise 10 is a COBOL program which serves to load a vector of N positions, printing the sum of its elements
 - Exercise 11 is a COBOL program for figuring out if an item is odd or even
 - Exercise 12 and 13 is a COBOL program for figuring out which element is the largest in an array
 - Exercise 14 n is a COBOL program for printing a list of words and finding the desired letter
 - Exercise 15 is a COBOL program that counts the number of letters present in a string, the letter is supplied by the user and the program makes sure to count only the one supplied, not distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase
 - Exercise 17 is a COBOL program which serves to load a vector of N positions, calculate the square of N numbers and then insert them into SQUARE, sorting it.
 - Exercise 19 is a COBOL program to see if two arrays are equal
 - Exercise 20 is a COBOL program to see who is the best or worst student in a class
 - Exercise 21 is a COBOL program that allows university students to book themselves for an exam, to take the exam, to receive an evaluation and then understand whether to pass or fail
 - Exercise 22 is a COBOL program for registering books in a library and searching for a book in it.
 - Exercise 23 is a COBOL program for searching for a class and figuring out the grades of a class and looking for the best grade and the worst grade
 - Exercise 24 describes a warehouse with a list of items description, stock, purchase price and sales price excluding VAT. to determine:inventory valuation,alphabetical price list printing showing description, sale price, without VAT and with 20% VAT
- Exercise 25 is to be finished 
- Exercise 26 is a cobol program that manages a registration and login system
- Exercise 27 is to be finished

## How to test them
To test my codes download an IDE that allows you to run a cobol code, for example OpenCobolIDE , load the codes and start the compilation and then the execution
